# Finder Project
this project is built using Python **argparse**, **threading**, **pickle**, **regularexpression**, **os** modules.
* the purpose of the project is to find any files on your system in **milliseconds**.
* even if you don't know the file name,search the file with 2 or 3 words from start or end of the file and it will find you the matched files with those characters.
* Optimized for time and speed.

# Dependency
* for the file to seach in less time the disk need to be indexed(improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a disk) as a whole, then individually.

> To create index run in command prompt:
```bash 
   python filename -c
```
> to find the file on your local machine:
```bash
  python (pythonfilename) filename
  ```
